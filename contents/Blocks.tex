\part[Blocks]{The Founding Blocks of Mathematics}
\label{prt:blocks}

What are the founding blocks of mathematics?
For a long period, numbers were the only blocks.
Counting from 1, 2, 3 and so on were important
in many people's daily lives.
For the ancient Greeks,
geometry and shapes arised in importance;
particularly after
the belief that everything could be represented as rational numbers
was shattered.
After that, algebra and geometry were quite far apart
until Fermat and Descartes combined them together
by representing geometrical objects as algebraic equations.

However, most people will agree that
today, the most primitive founding blocks of mathematics
is the notion of sets.
Even numbers are now constructed by sets,
although they follow the rules that we know already
and we need not notice the subtlety of such constructions.
Hence it is crucial to understand
what is a set,
what operations we have on a set,
and when are two objects related.

Sadly, naive set theory came with some crucial paradoxes;
and a concretization was needed.
What derivations do we consider legal,
and what do we postulate its existence?
The most widely-used foundation is the ZFC theory.
