\label{chap:linalg}

Compared to analysis and topology,
linear algebra --- more generally, algebra ---
deals with the structure of spaces
under operations such as addition and multiplication.
Analysis tends to
start with complex definitions ending up with well-known results;
whilst algebra tends to
start with basic definitions and end up with complex results.

Linear algebra mainly deals with vector spaces,
which are spaces equipped with addition and scalar multiplication.
Then we observe linear maps,
which are functions which preserve the structure of vector spaces.
They possess some important properties,
and the understanding of linear algebra is crucial
for many undergraduate math courses.
