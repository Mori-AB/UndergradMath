\setsection{Compactness and Connectedness}
\label{sec:mcptcnt}

Now we define a notion for ``compactness.''
The history of the notion for compactness is not that easy
and the reasoning behind the terminology is quite vague,
as stated in \cite{cpt-hist}.

\begin{restatable}{definition}{limptcpt}
    \label{def:limptcpt}
    Let \(X\) be a metric space.
    If any infinite subset \(E\) of \(X\) has a limit point in \(X\),
    then \(X\) is said
    to be \define[compact!limit-point]{limit-point compact},
    or to have the \define{Bolzano-Weierstrass property}.
\end{restatable}
