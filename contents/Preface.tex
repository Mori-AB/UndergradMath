\setchapter*{Preface}

This book is a collection
of personal (but not neccessarily private) notes
while studying in undergraduate level math.
This is intended not for strictness and rigor,
although I would like to achieve that kind of skill.
This is also not my creative content,
since (as any undergraduate textbooks would do so)
the curriculum of the subject is fairly concrete already.

The purpose of this book is somewhat vague;
it is my attempt to solve problems in some textbooks,
and also an (exaggerated) attempt to comprehend viewpoints of
the textbooks that I have learned from.
Also, the goal to update this note on a regular basis
is very motivating;
hence I have decided to write this note.

Exercises would mainly come from English and Korean books,
since those are the languages that I comprehend.
For citations and quotes here and there,
references from other languages may also be included.
See the (not yet made) bibliography for the full list of references.
