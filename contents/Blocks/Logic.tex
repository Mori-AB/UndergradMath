\setchapter{Basic Logic} \label{chap:logic}

It is only natural that
logic has appeared before its use in mathematics.
Logic was always
---
and will always be
---
a crucial tool in understanding and criticizing other's opinion.

Logic in mathematics is not much different in the spirit;
indeed, it serves as a tool for answering these questions:
How do we decide whether a statement is true or false?
Given a set of true statements,
how can we construct some more true statements?
and so on.

Here we take a look on propositional logic,
and some aspects of first-order logic.
Also, it might be a good idea to introduce terms
such as definitions, theorems, propositions and more.
