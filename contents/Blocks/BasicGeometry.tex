\setchapter{Basic Geometry}
\label{chap:basicgeo}

Up to now we only have the notion of
logic,
sets
and the real number system.
Quite frankly,
these are the only things we need
to proceed to the next part.
However,
it is quite boring to see exercises that are kind of ``made up,''
rather than from real-world examples.

Now before we move to the next part,
we watch how the classical Euclidean geometry
is transformed into today's axiomatic geometry.
Although this is overlooked in many schools,
it serves as a good example of
learning the axioms and using them to prove propositions.
Also, some parts of this chapter
will appear in the distant future
when we learn differential geometry in \cref{chap:diffgeo}.
