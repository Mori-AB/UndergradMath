\setsection{Propositional Logic} \label{sec:plogic}

Propositional logic is one of the simplest forms of logic.
It deals with sentences such as
`If it rains, then we stay at home.
It rains.
Thus, we will stay at home.'
More formally speaking,
propositional logic is a branch of logic that deals with
propositions
and relations between them.
